# bsc-slave

Here you can find the source code of the BSC-SLAVE kernel module for 
the BCM2835 ARM soc used for the raspberry pi. I have tested it for 
the rasperry pi 2 but it should work for the model B+ too.

There is a precompiled version of the module available (bsc-slave.ko)
wich you can simply insert with

#> insmod bsc-slave.ko

It is compiled for the kernel version 3.18.12-v7+

If you d'ont have this kernel version (verify with: uname -r)you need to 
compile the module yourself. This is what the Makefile is for. 

There are many possibilities. I chose installing rpi-update. You can find instructions on: https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update
